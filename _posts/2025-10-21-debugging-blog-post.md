<h2>Debugging Intro</h2>


Debugging is the process in which you try to figure out what's wrong with the code. Basically troubleshooting the code to see what's wrong with it and how you can go about fixing the bugs or error in the code that's making it act up. 

For how I go debugging, I read the code to see where the issue might be residing. The most common errors are sometimes Syntax errors, which is when you accidentaly put the wrong notation, or forgot to put the notation for that part of the code. Then based on my knowledge of coding, and some help from the internet, I do my best to identify the bug/error, then I edit, delete or add in new code to fix the issue.
