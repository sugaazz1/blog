<h2>Debugging Intro</h2>


Debugging is the process in which you try to figure out what's wrong with the code. Troubleshooting the code to see what's wrong with it and how you can go about fixing the bugs or error in the code that's making it act up. 

For how I go debugging, I read the code to first see what the purpose of the code is, then if I see where the issue might be residing, I begin taking action. Among the various types of errors such as Syntax, RunTime, Identation, logical The most common errors are sometimes Syntax errors, which is when you accidentaly put the wrong notation, or forgot to put the notation for that part of the code. Then based on my knowledge of coding, and some help from the internet, I do my best to identify the bug/error, then I edit, delete or add in new code to fix the issue.
