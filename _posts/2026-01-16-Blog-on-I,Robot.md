Opinion on the movie I, Robot 

<h1> What was it about?  </h1>

The Movie “I, Robot”(2004) is a science fiction movie that takes place in the future; in a world where Artificial Intelligence(AI) is integrated into the everyday human lives. Almost everyone has one. The AI is integrated into human lives by means of being in the form of humanoids, programmed to always obey humans in addition to following strict laws from the programmers. The main three laws that keep them in check are known as “The three main laws of robotics”. The first law follows: 1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. Lastly 3) A robot must protect its own existence, as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. The plot goes as follows: the main character, detective Dell Spooner begins investigating a sudden mysterious death. The death revolves around a professor who worked with the creation of those humanoid AIs. After doing some investigating, the death makes spooner question whether the machines designed to protect us can also act independently and dangerously. Although the movie might’ve exaggerated its version of AI, it also stands to question if we can fully control, trust, and make decisions in AI systems. AI representation matters because they can often shape or warp the public understanding of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence affecting how people see and understand the risks and possibilities of real world AI.
